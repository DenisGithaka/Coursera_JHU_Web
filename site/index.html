        <p ><span>Greek Tortellini Skillet:</span>
Looking to please very picky little palates? One lit tester loved this simple skillet entree so much, she made it at home for her 2-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p><span>Sesame Beef Skewers:</span>
A bottle of sesame ginger dressing makes this dish amazing on any weeknight. And the pineapple salad easily caps off dinner. We can broil the beef, but it's better grilled.</p>
